# Alpha Ultimate Workdesk - System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Alpha Ultimate Workdesk is a comprehensive workflow management system built with Flask that streamlines business operations including purchase requests, cash demands, expense records, and employee registrations. The application features a modern dark-themed interface with role-based access control and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with password hashing
- **File Handling**: Custom file upload system with secure filename generation
- **Reporting**: PDF generation using ReportLab with matplotlib for charts

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with custom dark theme
- **Icons**: Feather Icons
- **Charts**: Chart.js for dashboard analytics
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF with WTForms for form validation

## Key Components

### Database Models
- **User**: Authentication and user management with admin privileges
- **PurchaseRequest**: Business purchase request workflow
- **CashDemand**: Cash disbursement requests
- **ExpenseRecord**: Expense tracking with multiple items
- **ExpenseItem**: Individual expense line items
- **EmployeeRegistration**: New employee onboarding workflow

### Form Handling
- **LoginForm**: User authentication
- **PurchaseRequestForm**: Purchase request submission
- **CashDemandForm**: Cash demand requests
- **EmployeeRegistrationForm**: Employee registration applications
- **ExpenseRecordForm**: Detailed expense submissions with file uploads

### File Management
- Secure file upload with type validation

4. **Review**: Admin review through dedicated approval interface
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time status tracking for users
6. **Reporting**: Aggregate data available in admin reports

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Password verification using Werkzeug security
3. Session creation with user ID storage
4. Role-based access control for admin functions
5. Automatic logout and session management
